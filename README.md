I don't think I've got the chops for this one for the full list but hey ho.

## smol python script go brrrrrrr

  * 'day1part1.py' - brute force python approach to the solution. Works.
  * 'day1part2.py' - Again, brute force simple non-pythonic approach

These answers are stupid brute-force that because they just iterate and
will find multiple (duplicate) answers. Doesn't matter, got results.

  * 'day2part1.py' - simplest way I could think to process on read. Does create JSON output for part2 though.
  * 'day2part2.py' - would it surprise anyone to find I had off-by-one problems getting chars out? Relies on JSON from part1. Does get right answer
